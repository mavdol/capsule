# Capsule MCP Server

Give your AI agent the ability to write and run Python and JavaScript code, in a secure sandbox.

Every execution happens inside its own WebAssembly sandbox with strict resource limits. No file system access, no network by default, no risk to your host machine.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_python` | Run Python code in an isolated sandbox |
| `execute_javascript` | Run JavaScript code in an isolated sandbox |

Each tool returns the result of the last evaluated expression.

### Example

Ask your AI agent:

> *"I have monthly revenue of [12400, 15800, 14200, 18900, 21000, 19500]. What's the average and which month grew the most?"*

The agent calls `execute_python` with:

```python
revenue = [12400, 15800, 14200, 18900, 21000, 19500]

avg = sum(revenue) / len(revenue)
growth = [revenue[i] - revenue[i-1] for i in range(1, len(revenue))]
best_month = growth.index(max(growth)) + 2  # +2 for 1-indexed and offset

{"average": round(avg, 2), "best_growth_month": best_month, "growth": max(growth)}
```

→ `{"average": 16966.67, "best_growth_month": 4, "growth": 4700}`

The code runs in a Wasm sandbox, the result comes back, and nothing was executed on your system.

## Setup

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g. Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capsule-sandbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@capsule-run/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The server ships two pre-compiled WebAssembly modules: one for Python, one for JavaScript. When a tool is called, the code is executed via `capsule` inside a dedicated Wasm sandbox with:

- **Isolated memory** — each execution gets its own address space
- **CPU limits** — fuel-metered execution prevents runaway loops
- **No host access** — no filesystem or network unless explicitly allowed

## Build

```bash
npm install

# Build everything (wasm sandboxes + TypeScript)
npm run build

# Or separately:
npm run build:wasm   # compile sandbox sources to .wasm
npm run build:ts     # compile TypeScript to dist/
```
